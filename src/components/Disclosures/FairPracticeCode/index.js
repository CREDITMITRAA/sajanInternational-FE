                                The Company has laid down appropriate internal principles and procedures in determining interest rates and processing and other charges.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The board of directors of the Company has adopted an interest rate model taking into account relevant factors such as cost of funds, margin and risk premium for determining rate of interest to be charged for loans and advances.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The rate of interest shall be disclosed to the borrower or customer in the application form and communicated explicitly in the sanction letter and is also made available on the website of the Company.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The rate of interest to be charged depends much upon the risk profile of the borrower. The rate of interest will be annualized so that the borrower is aware of the exact rates that would be charged to the account. The Company will undertake to carry out due diligence on the borrower's repayment capacity, and comply with RBI's Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines.
